  """
    Your extreme ghost-hunting, pellet-nabbing, food-gobbling, unstoppable
    evaluation function (question 5).
    DESCRIPTION: <write something here so we know what you did>
    I want to incentivize winning so I return infinity if that is a win state.
    A large part of my strategy was "don't die." Dying gives you usually ~300 or less points, which will hurt your average. Winning usually gives
    you more points than losing.
    Here are the things I considered, along with some commentary on my decision making regarding them:1

    distance to the closest ghost: (disttoghost): I wanted pacman to run away from ghosts if they got too close. I did this
    by doing score += max(disttoghost, 4) * 2. If the ghost is more than distance 4 away, I didn't really care, and there is no difference between
    the ghost being 5 away and 500 away, because it's not close enough to threaten pacman. I added the max because my pacman would sometimes try to get
    farther away from a ghost already a long way away instead of going for food. That led to a lot of pacman idling in corners, wasting time and points. I added
    the * 2 so that the penalty for being near a ghost would be more severe and hopefully cause pacman to tend away from getting too close.

    closest food: I wanted to reward heading towards food, but not to the extent that it overrode the penalty of getting too close to a ghost. Thus, the score
    will be higher the closer pacman goes towards a food. By subtracting 1.5 * the distance, I got further distances to food to receive lower scores. This, however,
    introduced a problem where sometimes pacman would refuse to eat an isolated food because that would make the next turn's distance to food much higher. Thus, I had
    to add the next thing.

    bonus for eating food: I subtracted 4 times the number of remaining foods, so that eating food would cause a more markedly higher score. You can only eat one food
    per move, so this made eating food preferable over not eating food.

    capsules: I thought that eating ghosts would increase my score, so I tried to slightly incentivize moving onto a capsule so that eating ghosts could increase my score.
    Thus, I subtracted 3.5 from scores for each existing capsule. This would only make a difference near the capsule.

    I then watched pacman's actions and adjusted the weights and numbers to visible strategic flaws.

    When I last submitted this, this averaged slightly over 1000. Let's hope it does so again.
